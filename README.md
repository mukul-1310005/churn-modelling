# churn-modelling
A basic ANN model that predicts whether a person is gonna leave bank in future or not.
Model is based on present condition of a individual like his salary, time with bank, etc., and predicts his/her future actions towards bank.
As I trained it on 100 epochs, where we can see that while training after 40 to 50 epochs, accuracy almost remain constant for futher epochs.
This mean that our model based on given parameters has stopped learning much from training data.
